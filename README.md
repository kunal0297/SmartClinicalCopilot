## ⚠️ Why Smart Clinical Copilot?

In today’s healthcare landscape, clinicians face overwhelming patient data, time-critical decisions, and fragmented EHR systems. Smart Clinical Copilot is a powerful tool designed to:

* Decode complex FHIR records in real-time
* Summarize clinical histories and flag risks
* Recommend next steps in diagnostics or treatment
* Provide guardrails for safer, smarter care

This isn’t just a project — it's a vision for AI-augmented healthcare that works.

## 🧪 Sample Flow

### Input (FHIR Data Extract):

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "name": [{ "family": "Singh", "given": ["Asha"] }],
  "condition": [{ "code": "I10", "description": "Hypertension" }],
  "medicationStatement": [
    { "medicationCodeableConcept": { "text": "Lisinopril" }, "status": "active" }
  ]
}
```

### Output (Copilot Response):

* ✅ Chronic condition detected: Hypertension
* ⚠️ Missing labs: No recent renal function or BP data
* 📊 Medication: Lisinopril — check potassium levels
* 🧠 Suggested actions: Order CBC, ECG; monitor BP trends
