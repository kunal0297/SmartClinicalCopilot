##  System Architecture Overview

```
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- FHIR Server: http://localhost:8080
- IRIS: http://localhost:52773

## üß™ Testing
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest

# Frontend tests
cd ../frontend
npm test
```


## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- **Python version**: Use Python 3.9 or 3.10 for best compatibility.
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project root.
- **SMART/FHIR errors**: Ensure all SMART and FHIR env variables are set.
- **LLM explanations not working**: Set your OpenAI API key in `.env`.
- **Rule validation errors**: Check YAML files in `backend/rules/` for required fields (`id`, `text`, `conditions`, `actions`).
- **C extension errors**: Run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` in `backend/`.
- **Docker issues**: Ensure Docker Desktop is running and ports are not in use.

## ‚úÖ Post-Setup Checklist
- [ ] Backend starts with `python app.py` (no import/module errors)
- [ ] Frontend starts with `npm run dev` (shows UI at http://localhost:3000)
- [ ] API docs available at http://localhost:8000/docs
- [ ] Rule YAML files load without critical errors
- [ ] `.env` file is present in `backend/` and all required keys are set
- [ ] (Optional) LLM explanations work if OpenAI key is set

## üìö Clinical Guidelines

The system implements rules based on the following guidelines:
- KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guidelines
- ACC/AHA Guidelines
- ADA Standards of Medical Care
- CDC Guidelines
- GOLD Guidelines

 Example Clinical Use Case
Patient: 68 y/o male with CKD Stage 4, prescribed ibuprofen

## Workflow:

System retrieves patient data via FHIR API from IRIS

Trie Matcher identifies NSAID nephrotoxicity rule conflict


Alert Generator flags severity: High

LLM Reasoning Module explains:

"This patient has advanced chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 30) and is prescribed ibuprofen, a nephrotoxic NSAID. According to KDIGO 2021 guidelines, NSAIDs should be avoided in this population due to the risk of renal function deterioration."
