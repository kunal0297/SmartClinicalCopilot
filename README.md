## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- **Python version**: Use Python 3.9 or 3.10 for best compatibility.
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project root.
- **SMART/FHIR errors**: Ensure all SMART and FHIR env variables are set.
- **LLM explanations not working**: Set your OpenAI API key in `.env`.
- **Rule validation errors**: Check YAML files in `backend/rules/` for required fields (`id`, `text`, `conditions`, `actions`).
- **C extension errors**: Run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` in `backend/`.
- **Docker issues**: Ensure Docker Desktop is running and ports are not in use.

 Example Clinical Use Case
Patient: 68 y/o male with CKD Stage 4, prescribed ibuprofen

## Workflow:

System retrieves patient data via FHIR API from IRIS

Trie Matcher identifies NSAID nephrotoxicity rule conflict

Alert Generator flags severity: High

LLM Reasoning Module explains:

"This patient has advanced chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 30) and is prescribed ibuprofen, a nephrotoxic NSAID. According to KDIGO 2021 guidelines, NSAIDs should be avoided in this population due to the risk of renal function deterioration."
